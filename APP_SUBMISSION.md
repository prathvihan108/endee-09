# Internship Selection Project: Resume Screening AI- Prathviraj H(CMRIT College)

This file outlines my technical submission for the Endee Labs internship selection process.

## 🏗 Project Overview

To demonstrate a professional production-grade setup, I have separated the system into two distinct layers:

1. **The Engine (This Fork):** Handles high-performance vector storage.
2. **The App (External Repo):** A FastAPI backend that performs PDF text extraction and semantic AI embedding generation.

> **Note:** Locally, I have renamed this repository folder to **"endee-09"** to keep the workspace organized.
